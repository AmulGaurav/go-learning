The for loop is the only loop statement in Go. It has a number of forms, one of which is illustrated here:
```go
for initialization; condition; post {
	// zero or more statements
}
```

Parentheses are never used around the three components of a for loop.

Any of these parts may be omitted. If there is no initialization and no post, the semicolons may also be omitted:
```go
// a traditional "while" loop
for condition {
	// ...
}
```

If the condition is omitted entirely in any of these forms, for example in
```go
// a traditional infinite loop
for {
	// ...
}
```
