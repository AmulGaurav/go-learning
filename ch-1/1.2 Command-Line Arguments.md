Command-line arguments are available to a program in a variable named Args that is part of the `os` package.

The variable `os.Args` is a slice of strings. Slices are a fundamental notion in Go, think of a slice as a dynamically sized sequences of array elements where individual elements can be accessed as `s[i]` and a contiguous sub-sequence as `s[m:n]`. The number of elements is given by `len(s)`.

> As in most other programming languages, all indexing in Go uses **half-open intervals** that include the *first* index but exclude the *last*.

A slice expression of the form `s[m:n]` yields a slice that refers to elements `m` through `n-1`. If m or n is omitted, it defaults to `0` or `len(s)` respectively, so we can abbreviate the desired slice as `os.Args[1:]`.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
) 

func main() {
	var s, sep string

	for i := 1; i < len(os.Args); i++ {
		s += sep + os.Args[i]
		sep = " "
	}

	fmt.Println(s)
}
```

A variable can be initialized as part of its declaration. If it is not explicitly initialized, it is implicitly initialized to the **zero** value for its type, which is `0` for *numeric* types and the *empty* string `""` for strings.
